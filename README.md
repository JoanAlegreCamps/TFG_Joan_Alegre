# TFG_Joan_Alegre -> mtDNA-aging-pipeline

This repository contains the code developed for a Bachelor's Thesis project focused on analyzing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) dynamics during replicative aging in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The workflow combines microfluidic time-lapse fluorescence microscopy with semi-automated image processing and quantification tools.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to build a reproducible, semi-automated analysis pipeline that simplifies the quantification of mitochondrial and mtDNA fluorescence over time in individual yeast cells. The tools developed here are intended to support future biological studies on mitochondrial inheritance, aging, and cell cycle dynamics.

The project includes:
- Python scripts for background subtraction and fluorescence data processing.
- Fiji macros for semi-manual cell tracking and measurement.
- Integration with Cell-ACDC for segmentation and tracking based on the BABY model.

## âš™Installation Requirements

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Fiji/ImageJ (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/)  
- Git  

### Installing the pipeline
